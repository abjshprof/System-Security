Transparent Application Functionality Extension:
an extension that automatically creates backup copies of files before they are overwritten. detects any attempt to overwrite an existing
file, e.g., opening a file for write access, opening a file with truncate flags, truncating a file, renaming a file,
etc. In all of those cases, the extension copies the existing file into a backup directory, say, .backup within the user's home directory.




Instructions for usage:

cp ./mybackup ~/
make (will build libbackup.so)
export LD_PRELOAD=<path to libbackup.so>

Backup folder is in ~/bakckup

NOTE:
For some reason, some of my backups are created as .xyz
Please check using ls -a during your tests
